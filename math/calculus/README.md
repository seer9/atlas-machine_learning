In this project ill be learning key concepts of caluclus and answering some equations.

Must know!!!

Derivatives:

A fundamental in calculus that measures how a function changes as its input changes. In simplest terms; It tells you the pace at which,increasing or decreasing, a quantity is changing at any given time.

- Slope of a Curve: The derivative of a function at a point gives the slope of the tangent line to the curve at that point.

- Instantaneous Rate of Change: It represents the instantaneous rate of change of the function with respect to one of its variables.

- Notation: The derivative of a function (f(x)) with respect to ( x ) is often denoted as ( f'(x) ) or (\frac{df}{dx}).

- Notation: If (f(x)) is a function, its derivative is denoted as (f'(x)) or (\frac{df}{dx}).

- Sigma Notation (Σ) is a precise way to represent the sum of a sequence of numbers. The Greek letter sigma (Σ) is used to indicate summation.

- Σ: The summation symbol.
- i: The index of summation, which takes on integer values from (a) to (b).
- a: The lower limit of summation (starting value of ( i )).
- b: The upper limit of summation (ending value of ( i )).
- f(i): The function or expression to be summed.

Evaluate the sum: [ \sum_{i=1}^{5} i^2 ]

Write the following sum in sigma notation: [ 3 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 15 ]

Evaluate the sum: [ \sum_{k=0}^{3} (k^2 + 2k) ]


Variables:

- n: Typically represents the upper limit of the summation. It indicates the number of terms to be summed. In the context of derivatives and integrals, n can represent the degree of a polynomial or the number of terms in a series. Determines the range or extent of the summation or series, which is crucial for calculating accurate results.

- u: Often used to represent a function or sequence whose terms are being summed.

- v: Can also represent another function or sequence, especially when dealing with multiple summations or products.

-u and v: These variables are often used to represent functions. For example, in the product rule for differentiation, u and v are functions of a variable (like x), and their derivatives are used to find the derivative of their product. Represent the functions or sequences being manipulated. Understanding their behavior is essential for applying rules like the product rule or chain rule in differentiation.
